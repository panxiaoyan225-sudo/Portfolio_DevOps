🚀 Portfolio Monitor & Auto-Warmer
An automated monitoring and orchestration pipeline using Azure DevOps designed to eliminate "Cold Start" latency on Google Cloud Run while providing real-time infrastructure alerts via Slack.

📋 Overview
This project provides a "Single Source of Truth" for infrastructure health, serving a triple purpose:

Cold Start Mitigation: Periodically "pings" the Google Cloud Run hosted portfolio to ensure the container remains warm and responsive for visitors.

Strategic Risk Mitigation: Automatically validates project configurations and logic before execution to eliminate human error and environment drift.

Real-time Alerting: Dispatches status reports and performance metrics to a dedicated Slack channel.

🛠️ Technical Stack
Language: Python 3.9

Cloud Provider: Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run)

Orchestration: Azure DevOps (Azure Pipelines)

Automation: YAML-based CI/CD Pipelines

Testing: Pytest (Logic & Config Validation)

Communication: Slack API (WebClient/Webhooks)

⚙️ Architecture & Automation
1. Cloud-Native Orchestration (Azure Pipelines)
The project has migrated from local Windows Task Scheduling to a fully containerized Azure DevOps workflow. This ensures 100% environment consistency:

Scheduled Heartbeat: Controlled via cron schedules within azure-pipelines.yml, keeping the Cloud Run instance active without manual intervention.

Automated Validation: Includes a dedicated Validate Logic & Config stage using pytest to verify Slack Webhooks and ticker lists before the main monitor runs.

Secret Management: Sensitive tokens are injected via Azure Pipeline environment variables (SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL), removing the risk of hardcoded credentials.

2. The Slack Integration
The system integrates with a custom Slack App to provide immediate transparency into the pipeline's health.

Automated Feedback: Provides immediate visual confirmation (e.g., ✅ status) upon successful pings or failure alerts for immediate troubleshooting.

Error Trapping: If the validation scripts detect a configuration error, the pipeline halts immediately and notifies the owner, preventing "silent failures."

🚀 Installation & Setup
Azure DevOps Configuration
Pipeline Import: Create a new pipeline in Azure DevOps pointing to this repository.

Variables: Define the following secret variables in your Azure Pipeline Library or Variable Group:

SLACK_WEBHOOK: Your unique Slack Webhook URL.

Deployment: The azure-pipelines.yml handles the environment setup (Python 3.9), dependency installation, and execution.
