# Portfolio Monitor & Auto-Warmer
[🚀 View Pipeline Logic Infographic](https://panxiaoyan225-sudo.github.io/Portfolio_DevOps/infographic.html)

Production-grade CI/CD pipeline with triple-platform orchestration (GitHub Actions, Azure DevOps, and GitHub Repos) handling automated "heartbeat" runs, real-time anomaly detection, and seamless ETL syncing.

## 🎯 Project Philosophy

Most modern cloud-native applications suffer from "Cold Start" latency on serverless platforms. This project demonstrates a **high-performance, low-footprint architecture** optimized for Google Cloud Run.

## 🏗️ System Architecture 

The framework orchestrates infrastructure health through five specialized layers.
1. **Ingestion Layer:** Multi-channel ingestion supporting **GitHub**, **GitHub Actions**, and **Azure DevOps Repos**. Any `git push` to either origin triggers a parallel automated workflow.
2. **Validation Layer (The Gatekeeper):** A "Fail-Fast" pre-check stage that validates environment variables (e.g., `SLACK_TOKEN`) and performs syntax compilation before script execution.
3. **Environment Sync:** Automated dependency management and Python 3.12 configuration with native UTF-8 support for cross-platform log compatibility.
4. **Persistence Layer:** Secure management of sensitive API tokens using Azure DevOps Variable Groups (`Portfolio-Secrets`) and GitHub Actions Secrets.
5. **Audit & Alerting:** A Slack-integrated monitoring system that detects performance anomalies and pushes real-time status notifications.

## 🔄 The Pipelines

* **Continuous Integration (CI):** Configured to trigger automatically on every `git push` to the `main` branch. This ensures that any code changes are immediately validated and tested on the local agent.
* **Dual-Cloud Scheduling:** * **Azure Pipelines:** YAML-based `cron` schedule for a 07:00 AM EST "Morning Warm-up."
    * **GitHub Actions:** Redundant `cron` schedule to ensure high availability and environment stability even during platform outages.
* **Fail-Fast Validation:** Every run begins with a logic gate that ensures credentials are live and the Python code is syntactically sound, preventing "silent failures" in production.
* **Self-Hosted Execution:** Powered by a local Windows agent to ensure zero-cost execution without cloud parallelism or execution time restrictions.

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

* **Repositories:** GitHub (Mirror/CI) & Azure DevOps Repos (Primary/CI)
* **Cloud Provider:** Google Cloud Platform (Cloud Run)
* **Orchestration:** Azure Pipelines & GitHub Actions
* **Agent Infrastructure:** Self-Hosted Windows Agent (PowerShell/CMD)
* **Automation:** Python 3.12 & YAML-based CI/CD
* **Monitoring:** Slack API (Webhooks), Requests, aiosmtplib

## 🚀 Installation & Setup

### Platform Configuration
1. **Azure DevOps:** * Download and configure a self-hosted agent in the `MyLocalLaptop` pool.
    * Map your `SLACK_TOKEN` in a Variable Group named `Portfolio-Secrets`.
2. **GitHub Actions:**
    * Configure a local runner with the `self-hosted` tag.
    * Add your `SLACK_TOKEN` to **Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions**.
